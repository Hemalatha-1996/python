# EDA and Feature Engineering of Google Play Store Dataset ðŸ“±ðŸ“Š

## Problem Statement  
With over 2.56 million apps on the Google Play Store, users have an overwhelming choice.  
This project aims to analyze the dataset of 10,841 apps with 20 features to uncover insights such as:  
- Most popular app categories  
- Apps with the largest number of installs  
- Apps with the largest size  
and more.

## Data Collection  
The dataset consists of 20 columns and 10,841 rows, capturing diverse app details including category, rating, size, installs, price, and more.

## Project Steps  
1. Data Cleaning â€“ Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Understanding trends and distributions  
3. Feature Engineering â€“ Creating new features to enhance analysis and modeling
